# Watch App

This is a watchOS standalone app, which communicates with the backend via Rest API and Websockets. It provides the users a way to record the audio, which gets transcribed by the server and sent to all other users. Furthermore they can see the other recordings in text form. Another possible feature would be to vibrate the watch on important calls.

## Configuration

All configuration is saved in `Configuration.swift`. There you can change the api aswell as the websocket url.
