# Web-App

This is an Angular CLI App, which was made for displaying all the incoming reports and missions. It also provides a map with all the users and their current location. The goal was to drag the reports to the users, which should do the task.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
